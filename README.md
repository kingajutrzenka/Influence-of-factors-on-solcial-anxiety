# Influence of Factors on Social Anxiety â€“ Linear Regression Analysis

## Project Description
This project explores which factors may influence the level of social anxiety.  
The analysis includes variables such as age, sleep duration, physical activity, diet, stress, and other lifestyle aspects.  
Linear regression was applied, combined with data visualization in Python.

## Dataset
- Source: [Social Anxiety Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/natezhang123/social-anxiety-dataset)  
- Content: survey responses covering lifestyle, health, and emotional factors 
- Number of observations: 11000  

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Linear regression modeling (scikit-learn)  
- Variable selection to identify the most relevant predictors  
- Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib

## Results
- Strongest predictors: **stress**, **sleep**, and **therapy sessions**.  
- Fewer hours of sleep and higher stress levels are associated with higher social anxiety.
